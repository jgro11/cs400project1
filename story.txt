  One hot day in the summer of 2020, a group of reckless college friends went for a hike in the middle of nowhere, Wisconsin. Exploring nature with a few beer cans in hand, the kids were off on adventure whereever the trail was going to take them. A few hours into the hike and the sun was already starting to set, things took a turn. It's always good to bring a slower friend with you on a hike. If you happen to come across bears, the whole group doesn't have to worry. Only the slowest in the group do. That was the lesson they were about to learn that day.
  
  Running from bears is a skill that not many people have. Usually a park ranger will tell you that bears can reach up to 30mph, but this isnt true if you have prepared yourself properly with empty beer cans. One day, these same reckless college friends ran into a bear and the slowest of the group began to get nervous. Luckily, they had many empty cans as artillery. Armed with aluminum, the young adults began to launch the can at the bear... wow was this a bad idea.
