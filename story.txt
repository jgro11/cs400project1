  One hot day in the summer of 2020, a group of reckless college friends went for a hike in the middle of nowhere, Wisconsin. Exploring nature with a few beer cans in hand, the kids were off on adventure whereever the trail was going to take them. A few hours into the hike and the sun was already starting to set, things took a turn. It's always good to bring a slower friend with you on a hike. If you happen to come across bears, the whole group doesn't have to worry. Only the slowest in the group do. That was the lesson they were about to learn that day.
